  <h2>Resume</h2>
  <p>This page will contain my personal resume. It will be a bit bare at the moment, as I am a freshman and have not had much opportunity to work besides the jobs I held during high school. I look forward to adding more things to it in the future.</p>
  <h2>PB&amp;J</h2>
  <p>This page contains instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with an instructional video as well.</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src = "images/pamssquash.jpg" alt = "Picture of me holding a squash">
  <p>My name is Dylan Baltrus and I'm a freshman here at IIT. I'm studying cybersecurity and am currently unsure what exactly I want to do with my degree, however I know I've always loved to work with computers. I am from Long Island, New York and am very glad to be here in Chicago given the circumstances. I love to work out, and to play basketball, ping pong, and video games. I'm a big fan of watching boxing and MMA.</p>
