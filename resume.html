  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <h3>Summer Tech Intern at Cold Spring Harbor School District</h3>
  <p>June 2019 to August 2020</p>
  <p>I was in charge of setting up hardware for the upcoming school year; I set up up computers, access points, printers, ran wires into the ceiling, etc. to ensure that the next school year ran without any delays or hiccups.</p>
  <h3>Manager at Kai Poke LLC</h3>
  <p>July 2017 to August 2020</p>
  <p>I started as a basic employee, serving food, dealing with customers up front. The restaurant served Poke, which is a Hawaiian cuisine that involves raw fish and vegetables, so cleanliness and thoroughness are exaggerated compared to another restaurant. After a year and a few months I was promoted to manager after I completed the food manager's course local to my town. Because of this job I have years of customer service experience, cut loins of fish, cut numerous vegetables, created schedules, trained new employees, and more.</p>
  <h3>Stock Person at Cold Spring Harbor Delicatessen</h3>
